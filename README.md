# NUMPY
# NumPy Exploration 🧠📊

A deep-dive into foundational NumPy operations for learning and mastering array manipulation, slicing, reshaping, broadcasting, and advanced iteration techniques.

## 🔧 What’s Inside
This project contains a Python script that explores:

- Array creation and basic attributes (`shape`, `dtype`, `itemsize`, `size`)
- Mathematical operations (sum, min, max, std, sqrt)
- Array slicing and indexing
- Reshaping, stacking (`vstack`, `hstack`), and splitting (`hsplit`, `vsplit`)
- Conditional operations and boolean masking
- Iterating using `nditer` with different orders and flags

## 📁 Files
- `numpy_basics.py`: Contains the full code with examples and outputs.
- `README.md`: You’re reading it!

## 🧪 Sample Concepts Covered

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(a.size)       # Number of elements
print(a.itemsize)   # Size of each element
print(a.reshape(3, 1))  # Reshaped array
```
💡 Why This Matters
Understanding NumPy is critical before jumping into machine learning, data science, or deep learning. This repo helps you build that foundation the practical way — with code.

📌 Requirements
Python 3.x
